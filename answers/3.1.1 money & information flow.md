# 3.1.1 Explain the money flow and the information flow in the acquirer market and the role of the main players.

## Money Flow:

The money comes from the issuer/bank (customer account) and pays the fees to each step up to the merchant.

#### Payment
The customer swipes their card or enters card details at the merchant's point-of-sale.
#### Authorization
The merchant's acquirer sends the transaction data to the relevant card network (Visa or Mastercard).
#### Card Network
The network forwards the information to the customer's issuing bank.
#### Credit analysis
The issuing bank decides whether to approve the transaction based on available funds and fraud checks.
#### Answer
The issuing bank sends its decision back to the network.
#### Liquidation
If approved, the issuing bank transfers the transaction amount to the acquirer's account, minus interchange fees.
#### Transfer to merchant
The acquirer, minus its own fees, deposits the remaining funds into the merchant's account.
