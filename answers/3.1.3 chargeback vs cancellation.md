# 3.1.3 Explain what chargebacks are, how they differ from cancellations and what is their connection with fraud in the acquiring world.

### Chargeback
When the customer opens a dispute for an payment requesting refund. Not necessarily talking to the merchant.

### Cancellation
It's triggered by the merchant in a friendly way. The customers funds are returned.

### Connection with fraud
Chargeback is and indicative of fraud. As this is a tool that allows the customer to protect itself from unrequested transactions. So, when used, we understand that the customer has been "attacked" at some level, which makes the customer and the card not secure anymore.
